I used the three-tier architecture. This is a client-server software architecture pattern in which the user interface (presentation), 
functional process logic ("business rules"), computer data storage and data access are developed and maintained as independent modules, 
most often on separate platforms.
Apart from the usual advantages of modular software with well-defined interfaces, the three-tier architecture is intended to allow 
any of the three tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently in response to changes in requirements or technology.
